   xTLxTLHostingWatchdog is a tool to allow for minimum downtime on Unreal or UT servers. 
xTLHostingWatchdog launches the server then continuously monitors it by sending out a query and waits for a response. 
If a response is not detected in the alloted time it kills the server process and restarts it.
